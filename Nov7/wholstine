 1) Why is there such a "learning curve" when learning a traditional programming 
 language such as Java?
 There is such a "learning curve" because at first you have to learn a whole new language and how to use it, then once
 you learn how to use it, you can apply it.
 2) What is learning to program ultimately about? 
 Learning to program is ultimately about learning to think logically and to approach problems methodically. 
 3) How does Scratch "lower the bar" to programming?
 By representing programs' building blocks with color-coded blocks.
 4) What is a statement in a programming language?  
 Simply a directive that tells the computer to do something.
 5) What is a Boolean expression?
 An expression that is either true or false.
 6) What is a conditional statement?
 Something that must be true in order for something to happen.
 7) What is a loop used for in a programming language?
 It can induce multiple executions of statements.
 8) What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?
 A local variable can only be used for one thing, while a global variable can be used for all things.
 9) What is a Boolean variable?
 A variable that only takes on a value of true or false. 
 10) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered threads?
 The blocks such as: (when started) (forever) (if)
 11) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered event handlers?
 Blocks such as (when I receive <event>)
 12) How many sprites are implemented in Oscartime?
 Nine sprites are implemented in Oscartime.
 13) How many threads are used to display the Oscartime game instructions?
 One thread are used to display the Oscartime game instructions.
 14) How many threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite?
 Three threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite.
 15) What programming constructs does Scratch NOT support?
 Methods, Parameters, Return Values, Inheritance and Polymorphism are all NOT supported by Scratch.
